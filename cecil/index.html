        <h2>Why Cecil?</h2>
        <p>In the past ten years, we have seen a decentralization of our financial systems. This shift
            has democratized and expanded financial inclusion around the world. Here at Cecil, we're working to
            bring that same approach to the freelance gig economy. Fiverr and Upwork have helped bring millions of 
            freelance workers to find gigs, while this is a net positive, both platforms are built with sellers in mind.
        </p>
        <p>Cecil is an open-sourced, and community-driven platform giving Freelancers power over their own careers.
            By taking minimal selling fees, allowing holders to vote on company matters, and enforcing minimum wage
            standards, Cecil aims to be a viable alternative to Fiverr and Upwork
        </p>
        <p>By utilizing the power of Cardano's smart contract technology, we can ensure fast, affordable,
             and secure transactions to deliver at scale. As well as building in an ecosystem that we believe will
             seervice hundreds of millions, as the demand for decentralized applications grows in the coming years.

            <h2>FAQS</h2><br>
            <h3>Why are we building Cecil?</h3>
            <p>Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork have become unsustainable for good-faith freelancers.
                With high commission fees, no copy write enforcement or consistent moderation; Sellers often
                lower prices to compete with exploited laborers.
            </p>
            <h3>What are the benefits for Sellers on Cecil?</h3>
            <p>Seller commission fees below 5%. All sellers are granted a "kill clause" in each contract,
                allowing them to terminate contracts without penalty.
            </p>
            <h3>How will this differ from Fiverr and Upwork?</h3>
            <p>Cecil will enfore copy write infringement, which doesnt't happen at Fiverr. Cecil is an
                open-sourced platform, allowing sellers who make their livelihood on our platform to 
            evaluate our systems.</p>
            <h3>Why a minimum charge for products and services?</h3>
            <p>In order to prevent labor exploitation we will be enforcing minimum charges based on 
                product type and services. Sellers no longer have to compete with individuals working for $3 USD 
                per hour, while sellers in developing nations are not racing to the bottom for the lowest possible
                wages.
